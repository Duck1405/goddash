# Prism Mono

The brand new frontend for the Prism dashboard, built with shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS and in React.

## Standalone build guide

```
npm install
npm run build```

The files will now be accessible in `dist/`. If the app is located inside the Prism directory under `app` then Prism will serve `app/dist/` (as of Adelante 105) to the user. Have a look: `modules/routing.js`.
